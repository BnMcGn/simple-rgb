This is a simple, ASDF-loadable library for basic manipulation of RGB color tuples.  It was designed primarily for use with HTML and SVG, so is probably not suited for intense image manipulations.

See [the documentation](API.md).

There is also a related library, [cl-colors](http://www.cliki.net/cl-colors), which is a somewhat tied to X11 and uses fractional values for RGB tuples instead of the byte-sized format simple-rgb uses.

Version 0.02 (August 30, 2008) fixes a silly spelling error, replacing _compliment_ with _complement_.
